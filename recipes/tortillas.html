    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> This traditional flour tortilla recipe makes soft and delicious homemade tortillas that taste much better than store-bought. Do not substitute vegetable oil or shortening for the lard.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lard</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Rub in lard with your fingers until mixture resembles cornmeal. Add water and mix until dough comes together. </li>
        <li> Transfer dough onto a lightly floured surface; knead for a few minutes until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into 24 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. </li>
        <li> Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Use a well-floured rolling pin to roll a dough ball into a thin, round tortilla. Place into the hot skillet, and cook until bubbly and golden; flip and continue cooking until golden on the other side. Place the cooked tortilla in a tortilla warmer; continue rolling and cooking the remaining dough. </li>
    </ol>
